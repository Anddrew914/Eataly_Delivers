Eataly Delivers. A React and Rails fullstack Project.

Project:
We are setting out to design a website that allows for a restarant owner
to quickly and easily edit a menu offering for delivery to clients. The menu
will be dynamically rendered and will look stylistically appropriate for the rest
of the site.

Why React? React allows for components to be dynamically generated after the
owner adds a product to the menu. 

Why Rails? Rails is battle tested and is easy and fast to get built.
